<analysis>
The AI engineer successfully developed a full-stack WebGL Mandala Generator application iteratively. The initial phase focused on integrating the  component into a React frontend with Three.js. Significant effort was dedicated to UI/UX enhancements, including a Spotify-like theme, preset management, and advanced image kaleidoscope with HSL adjustments. The trajectory reveals a robust debugging process, addressing critical issues like a non-functional WebGL preview due to React version incompatibility, and persistent UI elements. The audio-reactive mandala feature was introduced and refined through multiple iterations, tackling complex state management and user override logic. Challenges included ensuring responsive canvas sizing while preserving export quality, and correctly handling user interactions versus automated updates. The final tasks involved fine-tuning text overlay features with custom fonts, automatic line breaks, and line height control, before receiving a final UI rearrangement request.

<product_requirements>
The application is a full-stack WebGL Mandala Generator, allowing users to create and customize dynamic mandala patterns.
Initial requests and implemented features include:
- Real-time WebGL rendering with adjustable symmetry, glow, speed, scale, colors, and center position.
- High-resolution PNG export.
- UI overhaul: Sleek dark theme (Spotify-like), modern card layouts, tabbed interface (Geometry, Colors, Effects, Text).
- Text Overlay: Customizable text content, size, position, alignment, color, bolding, background dimmer. Default: off, centered when enabled.
- Preset Management: Save/load configurations using local storage. (Later improved to visual interface).
- Image Kaleidoscope: Upload custom images, controls for mix, scale, rotation, offset, HSL adjustments, and mirroring.
- Visual Effects: Ripple/wave distortions, toggleable stars with density/intensity. Default: stars off.
- Responsive Preview Sizing: Adjust mandala preview to 1:1, 16:9, 9:16 aspect ratios without compromising final export quality. (Later refined to specific visual sizes).
- Command Panel: Small, non-intrusive panel indicating active features (on/off status).
- Audio Reactivity (later removed): Generate mandalas based on audio frequencies (Bass, Mid, Treble affecting glow, speed, scale, colors, then expanded to kaleidoscope parameters). Included audio recording and discard functionality. Audio controls should not interfere with manual adjustments.
- UI control for audio modes (Geometry, Kaleidoscope, Both).
- UI Reorganization: Main control menu on right (1/3 width), WebGL canvas on left (2/3 width). No duplicated elements.
- Text Overlay Enhancements: Automatic line breaks, Rosario font (bold, italic, normal), and line height control.

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Full-stack Architecture**: React (Frontend), FastAPI (Backend).
- **WebGL Rendering**: Three.js library with custom GLSL shaders.
- **UI Frameworks**: Shadcn UI components, Tailwind CSS.
- **State Management**: React Hooks (useState, useEffect, useRef, useMemo, useCallback).
- **Data Persistence**: localStorage for presets.
- **Browser APIs**: MediaRecorder API for audio recording.

<code_architecture>
The application adheres to a standard full-stack structure:


-   :
    -   **Importance**: Main React entry point, sets up routing.
    -   **Changes**: Integrates  as the primary application view.

-   :
    -   **Importance**: The central component for WebGL rendering, UI controls, and state management. Most development occurred here.
    -   **Changes**:
        -   **WebGL Setup**: Defined and synchronized numerous GLSL uniforms (e.g., , , , , , ).
        -   **UI Controls**: Extensive use of Shadcn UI components for sliders, inputs, and buttons.
        -   **State Management**: Heavy reliance on ,  for side effects,  for canvas elements/animations,  and  for performance optimization, especially in audio processing and manual override systems.
        -   **Text Overlay**: Integrated a  element for text rendering, with controls for content, size, position, alignment, color, bolding, background dimming (). Implemented automatic word wrapping, Rosario font integration, and line height control.
        -   **Image Kaleidoscope**: Added image upload, texture application (), and controls for , , , , HSL adjustments (), and . Texture filtering updated to  for quality.
        -   **Effects & Stars**: Controls for  (ripple/wave), , , and star properties (, , , ). Default states set.
        -   **Preset Management**: Implemented  and  using , storing all mandala parameters. Later refactored to a visual UI with input field, save/load/delete buttons for each preset.
        -   **Export System**:  combines WebGL output and text for high-resolution PNG export. Functionality was debugged to ensure it worked across all aspect ratios.
        -   **UI Layout & Styling**: Major refactoring for Spotify-like aesthetic: pure black background, dark sidebar (1/3 width, right), WebGL canvas (2/3 width, left), green buttons (#1DB954), sans-serif typography. Tabs for control panels implemented.
        -   **Responsive Preview**: Logic for 1:1, 16:9, 9:16 aspect ratios. Initially had issues with 9:16 occupying too much space and degrading resolution; fixed by setting  to full resolution and scaling  via CSS for visual display.
        -   **Audio Reactivity (Removed)**: Temporarily implemented audio upload, recording via MediaRecorder API, frequency analysis (Bass, Mid, Treble mapping to mandala parameters like glow, speed, scale, image scale, rotation, mix, position, HSL shifts), and a persistent audio control bar. This feature, including all related states, functions, and UI elements, was fully removed by user request.
        -   **Bug Fixes**: Addressed duplicate UI elements, non-functional WebGL preview (React 19 downgrade to 18), text rendering issues (real-time updates, initial centering), quick actions not triggering, audio blocking manual controls (user override system implemented), and image pixelation.

-   :
    -   **Importance**: FastAPI backend for API endpoints.
    -   **Changes**: No explicit changes mentioned. Provides a basic Hello World and  endpoint with MongoDB interaction.

-   :
    -   **Importance**: Manages frontend dependencies.
    -   **Changes**:  (Three.js) added. React downgraded from v19 to v18 to resolve compatibility issues.

-   :
    -   **Importance**: Main HTML file.
    -   **Changes**: Added Google Fonts link for Rosario font.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer was working on enhancing the Text Overlay functionality. The user had requested several improvements: automatic line breaks for large text, the use of the Rosario font from Google Fonts (supporting bold, italic, and normal styles), and the addition of a line height control.

The AI engineer successfully implemented these features by:
1.  Adding the Google Fonts link for Rosario to .
2.  Introducing new React states for  and  in .
3.  Updating the  function to incorporate word-wrapping logic, apply the Rosario font, and use the  and  states.
4.  Ensuring  dependencies were updated to trigger re-renders when these new text properties changed.
5.  Adding UI controls (a slider for Line Height and toggle buttons for Italic) to the Text panel within .
6.  Updating the preset saving/loading logic to include the new  and  parameters.

After confirming these implementations via screenshots and internal testing, the user provided new feedback: Coloque o box Line Height Logo abaixo dos Position X e Y. Bold ON/OFF e Italic coloque Junto ao box de cores. This new request for UI rearrangement is the immediate pending task.
